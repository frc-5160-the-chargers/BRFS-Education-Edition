## Fill in the blanks branch

This is an 'empty' version of the BRFS base code, allowing people to fill in custom drivetrain and input code

## Rohen's branch (to which Kaeshev, Jay, and Brooke also contributed) (but not as much)

> I made the branch, therefore I have naming rights.
> Also, I don't think my group noticed that there's a `readme.md` so I can basically put whatever I want here.
